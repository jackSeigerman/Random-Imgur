# Random-Imgur
a program to fetch random images from imgur. This occurs one at a time upon hitting a button. You can also download the image, or go back and view some previous images fetched.
## Disclaimer
Unfortunatley the internet is the internet, so upon retrieving an image from Imgur, there is no telling what you will get. Please see the [Imgur terms of service](https://imgur.com/tos) for more information. We did not create, place, or change the chances of generating any particular image or type of image.
## Getting Started
